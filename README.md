Business Problem
Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.
